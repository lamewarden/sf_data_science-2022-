### Project description
Guess the number with the least possible attempts 

### Task
Write a program for the efficient guessing

**Rules**
- Random number from 0 to 100 is taken, and we should compose a program which guesses it as efficient as possible;
- Program should take into account hints for every previous try (if it's smaller or bigger than the guessed number);

#### Evaluation
Results are evaluated according to the mean guess numbers for 1000 repetitions

**What do we practice?**
Learn how to write readable code in python
